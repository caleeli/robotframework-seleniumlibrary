# SeleniumLibrary 2.7 #

The primary motivation of SeleniumLibrary 2.7 was upgrading the included Selenium server to 2.0 beta 3 ([issue 176](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework-seleniumlibrary/issues/detail?id=176)) to get in the latest Selenium enhancements including enhanced Firefox 4 support. Most important bug fixes were including an add-on required by [Flex testing](FlexTesting.md) into the source distribution ([issue 179](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework-seleniumlibrary/issues/detail?id=179)) and resolving some problems in the included [Firefox profile](CustomFirefoxProfile.md) ([issue 193](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework-seleniumlibrary/issues/detail?id=193)). Some new keywords were also added and existing enhanced. The list below contains all the enhancements and bug fixes.

SeleniumLibrary 2.7 was released on Monday 2011-05-02. The installers are available on the [download page](http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-seleniumlibrary/downloads/list) and normal [installation instructions](InstallationInstructions.md) apply.
